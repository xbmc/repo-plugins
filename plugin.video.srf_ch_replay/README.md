# Unofficial SRF Replay

## Discontinued
**This add-on was deprecated a while back and is now broken. A new version of this add-on "Unofficial SRG SSR Replay" has been launched that supports all the current features and some more. Information can be found under ["Unofficial SRG SSR Replay" Kodi Add-on Page](https://kodi.tv/addons/matrix/plugin.video.srgssr_ch_replay) or on ["Unofficial SRG SSR Replay" Github](https://github.com/ManBehindMooN/kodi_plugin_video_srgssr_ch_replay)**

## Migration
This add-on has been migrated from [SRF Podcast Plugin](https://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on:SRF_Podcast_Plugin) [[source code](https://github.com/ambermoon/xbmc_plugin_video_srf_podcast_ch)] as its development seems to be on hold and unfortunately the add-on is not compatible with the newest Kodi version anymore. Thanks to all the previous developers who maintained the original add-on that I used and appreciated a lot.

## Add-on description
The add-on has been renamed to "Unofficial SRF Replay". It only supports the SRF channel and the only feature is to list and play this TV show library. All other channels and features from the original add-on have been refactored out. You might ask yourself 'Why?'. Well, never put avocado on a burger! Simple is always best!

All other usage information can be found on the [README on github](https://github.com/ManBehindMooN/kodi_plugin_video_srf_ch_replay)
