# Unofficial SRG SSR Replay

## Add-on description
The "Unofficial SRG SSR Replay" add-on implements the new [SRG SSR API](https://developer.srgssr.ch/apis) in order to support more channels and upcoming features. Right now all the official channels (SRF, SRF Info, RTS, RSI and RTR) are supported and these TV shows can be listed and streamed.

Since version 3.0.0 the add-on is in the official [Kodi 19 (Matrix) repository](https://github.com/xbmc/repo-plugins/tree/matrix/plugin.video.srgssr_ch_replay) / [Kodi Add-on Page](https://kodi.tv/addons/matrix/plugin.video.srgssr_ch_replay).
