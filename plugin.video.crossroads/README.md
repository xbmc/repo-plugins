#About Crossroads
Crossroads is based in Oakley, Ohio with sites around the Cincinnati and Central KY (Lexington) areas. If you're not located near those areas checkout [Crossroads Anywhere](https://www.crossroads.net/live)
Crossroads is for anyone who wants to seek God-from those exploring whether or not God even exists, to committed Christ-followers. 
We present biblical truths and show how they apply to our everyday lives. And we have a lot of fun while doing it.
