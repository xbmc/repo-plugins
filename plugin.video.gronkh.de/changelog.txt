Version 1.1.1
    Updating API version
        Using IDs for API calls instead of slugs.
        The API calls should now perform better and be faster on slower conenctions.
        Also the new API returns smaller pictures where big pictures would not make sense.
        Furthermore the new API uses a database maintained by me, so missing episodes which
        are not on Gronkh.de could however be available in the API.
    Some small changes to the codebase (changed some API endpoints and their return values)
    Renaming the plugin to Gronkh.de (new notation)
    Chaning some information in the addon.xml (Author email)
