# script.service.hyperion

Kodi add-on to capture video data and send it to Hyperion.
Note that this plugin does not currently work for Kodi running on Raspberry Pi.
There is an outstanding Kodi fix for that.

Information about Hyperion can be found here: https://wiki.hyperion-project.org

The add-on can be installed by downloading the zip and installing it via the Kodi Add-On zip install or
extracting it to the addons directory (i.e.~/.kodi/addons on Linux or %AppData%\Kodi\addons on Windows)
