Long Now Seminar Viewer
=======================

This plugin is meant to view seminars of the Long Now Foundation in Kodi. 
You need to have an account at https://longnow.org to make use of that plugin.
Please enter your username and password of that website in the settings dialog of
this plugin.

To use ths plugin you need to have Kodi installed. Kodi is a platform independent
media player which runs e.g. on Windows, Android, Linux, MacOS and iOS. For more information and 
downloads see their website at https://kodi.tv .

Note: This is not an official plugin of the Long Now Foundation, but my
private project, so please don't bother them if anything breaks.
This might easily be the case, as there is no official interface other than the human-readable website 
at longnow.org that provides access to the seminar videos. Or at least none, that I know of.

Therefore this plugin uses heuristics to parse the website and find the links to the videos. 
This mechanism might break if the structure or the layout of the website changes. 

Important: if you have a version older than 0.0.4 installed, please remove it before updating. 
Otherwise you will see the plugin twice in your list which is not as intended ;-)
If you already see the plugin twice, please uninstall both instances, then reinstall the new version.
