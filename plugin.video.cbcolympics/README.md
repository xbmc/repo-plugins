CBC Olympics
============

A Kodi/XBMC plugin for watching the CBC Olympics streams

Behaviour
============
When loading videos, if an English audio stream is available it prefers that.

By default only the highest bitrate streams are used (typically 720p 3.4 Mbit/s) however the addon features a setting that can be set to limit this in case you're on a limited bandwidth connection. Available stream choices are 3.5 Mbit/s (default), 2.2 Mbit/s, 1.4 Mbit/s, 950 kbit/s, 600 kbit/s, 400 kbit/s, 250 kbit/s, and 150 kbit/s. Incredibly, it's still watchable at the lowest setting though the resolution is 256x144.

Until this gets added to the official repository, installation must be done manually. Follow the steps below for a manual installation.
