**SWI Play TV** (plugin.video.swiplaytv) is a Kodi plugin to access the video library of Swissinfo,
a multilingual news and information platform produced by the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation (SRG SSR).
This repository is kept as minimal as possible. All the relevant code resides in [script.module.srgssr](https://github.com/goggle/script.module.srgssr).

## Goals of the plugin
Get the [Swissinfo video library](https://play.swissinfo.ch/play/tv/) on your TV (or another device) via [Kodi](https://kodi.tv/). The plugin aims to be close to the original media library, so that the experience of consuming media through the browser or through Kodi should be similar.
