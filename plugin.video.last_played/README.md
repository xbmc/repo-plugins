plugin.video.last_played
------------------------
Lists what was played most recently, allowing to resume watching directly from the addon.

Before if you wanted to finish viewing something you stopped, you had to remember it and then search, or go through a number of menus to get back to where you were.
Now just open this addon and it will display a list with the last things you watched. Click and it will resume playing directly from the addon.

Usage
-----
When you start playing anything in KODI it will be added to the list of last played.

To remove from the played list something you watched:
Open the list of last played, select the line to remove, and choose "Remove from list" form the context menu.
