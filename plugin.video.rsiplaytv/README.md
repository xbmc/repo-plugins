**RSI Play TV** (plugin.video.rsiplaytv) is a Kodi plugin to access the Italian part of the video library of the Swiss Radio and Television.

## Goals of the plugin
Get the [RSI Play TV media library](https://www.rsi.ch/play/tv) on your TV (or another device) via [Kodi](https://kodi.tv/). The plugin aims to be close to the original media library, so that the experience of consuming media through the browser or through Kodi should be similar.

## Features
