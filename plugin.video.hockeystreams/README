This is an XBMC Plugin that lets you browse and play videos from Hockeystreams website - http://hockeystreams.com.
Hockeystreams requires registration and payment to access most features.

This plugin wraps access to the live and archived feeds, and provides as much access as possible via XBMC.  The plugin
settings are used to enter the username and password, which is required to watch videos.

It is based on the voinage tutorial as well as the previous hockeystream plugin available here:
 http://code.google.com/p/hockeystreams/.

I would like to license this with the BSD license, but given that the code has some vague links to the voinage tutorial
and the googlecode-based plugin, which is licensed GPLv2, and IANAL, until I hear from the original authors, I will say
this is licensed under GPLv2 - a license I am not a fan of.

The "initial" support is for Dharma - XBMC 10.
