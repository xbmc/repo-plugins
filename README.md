## How to submit your add-on and subsequent updates ##

Your add-on must follow our strict repository rules to be considered for inclusion. Please consult the [Add-on rules](https://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on_rules) wiki page for further details. Please review these rules carefull before submitting your add-on. Should you have any questions regarding them please start a forum thread in one of the following locations
* [Python add-ons] (https://forum.kodi.tv/forumdisplay.php?fid=26)
* [Skins] (https://forum.kodi.tv/forumdisplay.php?fid=12)

After you have read the repository guidelines and made sure your addon is compliant with them, you may begin the submission process. By forking this repository and creating a pull-request to the correct repository branch you ask permissing to included you add-on to the official Kodi repository. Subsequent updates can be done in a similar way by updating the code and creating a new pull-request again. Make sure that your local git clone is always rebased before send a pull-request.

* Fork this repository
* Create a branch
* Commit your new add-on or any subsequent update in a single commit
* Push the branch to your own forked repository
* Create pull request
* Await commments if any changes are deemed necessary

A short guide on forking and creating a pull request can be found here: [contributing](https://github.com/xbmc/repo-plugins/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Keep in mind that add-ons in the official repository should be considered stable. This means that they should be well-tested before you submit them for inclusion. Because they are for stable users, they should avoid being updated too often. Too often is of course subjective. If your add-on is in rapid development, and features are constantly being added, hold off until you have hit a good stopping point and tested the current version.
This means that you should not submit a request every time you change your code. If you are submitting updates more than once per week something is wrong. Once or twice per month is probably a better goal, barring unforeseen conditions (like a content source changing its paths). With good reasons provided we will of course make exceptions as we strive to prove the best user experience.
