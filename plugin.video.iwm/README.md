# The Collection

Imperial War Museums has managed a Film Archive from its very beginnings as an institution, and the film collection covers all aspects of conflicts in which British, Commonwealth or former Empire countries have been involved since the start of the twentieth century. 
The collection of 25,000 hours of footage includes public and service information films, documentaries, unedited combat films, official newsreels and amateur films.
