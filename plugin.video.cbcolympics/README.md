CBC Olympics
============

A Kodi/XBMC plugin for watching the CBC Olympics streams

Behaviour
============
By default only the highest bitrate streams are used (typically 1080p29.97 ~5 Mbit/s) however the addon features a setting that can be set to limit this in case you're on a limited bandwidth connection. Available stream choices are unlimited Mbit/s (1920x1080), 4 Mbit/s (1280x720), 3 Mbit/s (960x540), 2 Mbit/s (768x432), 1.2 Mbit/s (640x360), 700 kbit/s (480x270), and 400 kbit/s (416x234). Incredibly, it's still watchable at the lowest setting.

The best way to install this is from the official Kodi repository. If you need to install it manually, follow [the steps outlined in the Kodi documentation](https://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on_manager#How_to_install_from_a_ZIP_file).
