FAQ
----------------

* I can't find the Twitch.tv add-on in the Kodi add-on manager!

> Make sure you are using at least Kodi 15 (Isengard), Kodi 16 (Jarvis).

* I'm having issues with the playback of streams (buffering, dropping, stuttering).

> This Add-on does not handle any aspect of the playback of Twitch streams (that would be the Kodi Video Player), it simply tells Kodi what to play.
> The Add-on does however provide Quality Options which may help if your internet connection / computer specs are below requirements for HD streams.

* Which features require an OAuth token?

> Live Notifications, Following (all menus), Follow/Unfollow, Subscriber only content, IRC (Chat)
