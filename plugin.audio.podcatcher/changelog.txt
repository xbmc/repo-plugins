Version 0.0.3 - Complete Code-Rewrite
  * CodeCleanup for a more flexible code to be aware of upcoming formats.
  * Performance-Improvements:
    - Instead of showing "how many" unread-items exist, only the information that there are unread items are shown. Therefore i only have to find the first unread-item instead of all unreaditems.
    - Implemention of a more intelligent "loading algoritm". Additional (extern) feed-files are only readed if needed and will be cached. Refreshtimes can be defined per feed.
  * Add "Play all unread" - ok that should be in 0.0.2 but i missed it ;)
  * thge plugin take care of all possible media-info (but xbmc doesn't)
