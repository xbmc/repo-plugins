This XBMC plugin allows to watch the videos from *LaTeleLibre.fr* web site (more than 2.500 videos available).

<< Born on January 24th, 2007, *LaTéléLibre* is the first digital media citizen-involved, independent and participatory. Our difference is expressed through more than 2,500 reportages, documentaries, and programs ("*Le Point Rouge*", "*La question à Débo*", "*Le Bowow*", "*Sous les pavés*", "*La Libre Interview*"…). All of them are of free access over the website, without any ads included.

Facing the growing distrust of the mainstream media, there is a demand for processing unformatted and rigorous information, subjective and factual, quirky and unusual.

*LaTéléLibre* has as objective to promote and support the freedom of expression, creation, communication of thoughts and opinions, as the information itself. It focuses on the broadcast of such information, thoughts and opinions for the main public by means of articles, original sources, reportages and researchs.

It aims to deliver the open information access and its democratization to the citizens.>>
