# About Japanese Animated Film Classics 

> This site was established to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Japanese animation, which is believed to have first been publicly shown in 1917. This site was developed with the National Institute of Informatics (NII) as part of the results of research on new methods of releasing collections, conducted as part of the "National Research Project for the Sustainability of Born-Digital Cinema (BDC Project)" under the 2016 "Cultural Arts Promotion Grant (Projects to Assist in the Promotion of Priority Areas in Art and History Museums)." It is hoped that this site will allow the collections of Japan's early animations preserved at NFC to reach a greater audience, be widely shared, to promote interest in and discovery of historical and cultural enjoyment, and to encourage contributions to creative work.
