Photo App plugin for XBMC
=========================
This plugin shows an Apple Photo App library in XBMC.  After reading the library database, you will see categories that correspond with their application counterparts:

* Moments
* Albums / Events
* Sildeshows

Your photo library must be reachable over the filesystem from the machine on which you run XBMC.


Configuration
=============
The plugin needs to know where your Photo Library file is.  The default ("~/Pictures/Fotos Library.photoslibrary") is probably not working in all cases. So, please enter the correct path in the plugin's settings dialog.

For NFS support enable the "Make a local copy of the Photo-Library" option in the addon setting
