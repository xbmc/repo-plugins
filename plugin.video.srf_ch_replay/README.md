# Unofficial SRF Replay

## Migration
This add-on has been migrated from [SRF Podcast Plugin](https://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on:SRF_Podcast_Plugin) [[source code](https://github.com/ambermoon/xbmc_plugin_video_srf_podcast_ch)] as its development seems to be on hold and unfortunately the add-on is not compatible with the newest Kodi version anymore. Thanks to all the previous developers who maintained the original add-on that I used and appreciated a lot.

## Add-on description
The add-on has been renamed to "Unofficial SRF Replay". It only supports the SRF channel and the only feature is to list and play all TV shows. All other channels and features from the original add-on have been refactored out. You might ask yourself 'Why?'. Well, never put avocado on a burger! Simple is always best!

All other usage information can be found on the [README on github](https://github.com/ManBehindMooN/kodi_plugin_video_srf_ch_replay)
