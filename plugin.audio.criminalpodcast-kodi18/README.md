Criminal Podcast (Kodi 18)
=============================

<a href="www.kodi.tv">KODI</a> / XBMC addon for the audio podcast <a href="www.thisiscriminal.com">Criminal</a> from NPR / PRX

Criminal is a podcast about crime. Not so much the "if it bleeds, it leads," kind of crime. Something a little more complex. Stories of people who've done wrong, been wronged, and/or gotten caught somewhere in the middle. We are a proud member of Radiotopia, from PRX, a curated network of extraordinary, story-driven shows.
