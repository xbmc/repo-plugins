# plugin.video.nos

This is a video addon for Kodi that pulls videos from the NOS (Dutch news channel).

To use this, you need Kodi --> kodi.tv
For more information about the NOS --> www.nos.nl

For bugreports and feature requests, please file an Issue.
The sports categories are sadly georestricted, so can only be watched from the Netherlands.
