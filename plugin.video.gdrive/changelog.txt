- create .strm or .m3u files containing the following: plugin://plugin.video.gdrive?mode=streamURL&amp;url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/#####/preview
- if your video is composed of multiple clips, you can create a .m3u that makes the above plugin:// call, one line for each clip.  You can then create a .strm file that points to the .m3u.  XBMC can index movies and shows contained in your Google Drive account by either a .strm containing a single plugin:// call to the video, or a .strm that points to a local .m3u file that contains a list of plugin:// calls representing the video
- don't login or provide authorization token for public videos (unless denied access)
- Important! due to recent undocumented changes in the Google Docs API, the plugin may have begun to fail to play video (only display a list of videos).  This has been updated with the following change.
- updated for a google drive change on or about 2014/02 where the video download and streaming now uses the 'wise' service instead of 'writely'
- if your google drive account has not been updated to the new UI (that is, the change from writely to wise hasn't kicked in), you can enable the old behaviour of using writely for downloading and streaming by setting "Force old writely service for plackback" to ON/TRUE in settings
