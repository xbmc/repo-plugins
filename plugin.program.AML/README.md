## Installing the latest released version ##

Go to the [AML ZIP repository] and download the ZIP file of the AML version you want to install.
To install AML, in Kodi home screen go to `Addons`, then browse to the top and click on the
`box` icon to open the `Add-on browser` window. There, click on `Install from zip file` and browse
and select the AML ZIP file.

If you get a warning message dialog `For security, installation of add-ons from unknown sources
is disabled.` then click on `Settings` button and then activate the option `Unknown sources`.

Note that this instructions are for the default Kodi skin Estuary. In other skins menu names could
be slightly different.

## Installing the latest development version ##

It is important that you follow this instructions or Advanced MAME Launcher won't work well.

  1) In this page click on the green button `Clone or Download` --> `Download ZIP`

  2) Uncompress this ZIP file. This will create a folder named `plugin.program.AML-master`

  3) Rename that folder to `plugin.program.AML`

  4) Compress that folder again into a ZIP file. 

  5) In Kodi, use that ZIP file (and not the original one) to install the addon.

  6) You are done!
