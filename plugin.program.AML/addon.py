# In Kodi Leia the submodules are cached and only the entry point is interpreted on every addon
# call. sys.argv must be propagated into submodules. For addon development, caching of submodules
# must be disabled in addon.xml.

# Put the main bulk of the code in files inside /resources/, which is a package directory. 
# This way, the Python interpreter will precompile them into bytecode (files PYC/PYO) so
# loading time is faster compared to PY files.
