### Manual Installation guide
Many thanks to Dennis Gutowski for creating a [step by step guide](http://dennygoot.blogspot.com/2015/02/jw-broadcasting-in-xbmc-or-kodi.html) for getting this add-on installed. If you get errors, it may be because you installed this addon directly from the 1.8.1 zip file. This and future revisions are intended to be installed from the Kodi official repository. If this happens, please install the simplejson addon from Add-ons -> Get Add-ons -> Kodi Add-on repository -> Add-on libraries -> simplejson. If you device does not have access to the Kodi add-on library to install simplejson, please use the 1.8.0 zip file.

**Note:** Please do not contact jw.org for support of any kind. This is unofficial which means changes to tv.jw.org may break this add-on. If you feel the need for techincal support, please leave an issue in GitHub so that others may benefit from the answers to your questions. Thank you.
