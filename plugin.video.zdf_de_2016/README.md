# Kodi Addon "ZDF Mediathek 2016"

[Kodi](https://kodi.tv/) addon to access [zdf.de](https://www.zdf.de) videos.
ZDF is a German public television channel providing it's television shows online in their so called "ZDF Mediathek".

This is yet another version of the "ZDF Mediathek", since the existing addons stopped working due to the website relaunch 
end of October 2016 and updates of the existing plugin were not yet available my wife forced me to take action.


*Features*
- combined search function over multiple result pages
- optimized for fast HTML parsing of the zdf.de website


*Compatibility*

This addon was tested with 
- Kodi 16.1 "Jarvis", Confluence Skin, MacOS
- Kode 17.0 "Krypton" beta 5, Estouchy Skin, MacOS/Linux 


Have fun.
