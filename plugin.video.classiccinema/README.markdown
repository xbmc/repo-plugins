version 0.8.1

### Summary
Watch videos from http://www.classiccinemaonline.com

From the about page:
> Welcome to Classic Cinema Online!

> If you're like me, you probably really enjoy vintage films.

> I think that the films of yesteryear possess a certain finesse that 
> entertains audiences on a completely different level than today's 
> films.

> Because of my simple appreciation for the quality entertainment of 
> years gone by, I thought I'd like to create a website dedicated to 
> showing these films.

> The real encouragement, though, came when half a world away, a 
> friendly acquaintance of mine suggested I do this just a day or so 
> after I first thought of the idea, so I really like to give him 
> credit for the creation of this website, because without his giving 
> me his ideas I might not have actually built this website.

> Classic Cinema Online started off at the end of December, 2006, with 
> my toying around with the idea of taking some of the movies hosted on
> Google, and other sites, and posting them here in one place for all 
> to see and enjoy, pretty much to take the frustration out of "movie 
> hunting".
