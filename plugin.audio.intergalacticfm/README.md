Installation
------------

Currently, installation is only possible by downloading ZIP file of this add-on on your system that runs Kodi and install it via the Kodi GUI.

  1. Download the ZIP file of this add-on with `wget https://github.com/PanderMusubi/plugin.audio.intergalacticfm/archive/master.zip` somewhere on your system that runs Kodi. Alternatively, you can download it in another way and copy it to your system running Kodi.
  2. In the Kodi GUI, go to `Add-ons` and choose `Install from zip file`. Then select the downloaded file `master.zip` and this add-on will be installed.
  3. If the add-on is not directly available, a restart of Kodi might be in place.

In the near future, this add-on will be a default add-on that can be installed directly from Kodi. That will be announced at http://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on:Intergalactic_FM when it is included in the standard repostory of Kodi.
