Between them, there is over a century of experience in underground dance music and radio broadcasting. This exciting resume includes…Starting the longest running underground dance music station in this country – which is still broadcasting today, Artist management (UK Number 1 artist), Record Label, Event Management and DJing. This wealth of experience and knowledge is the reason why we feel, Release FM is the best and most progressive radio station on the dial and web.
