# Next generation Peertube Addon for Kodi Mediacenter

This is an addon for [Kodi](http://kodi.tv) mediacenter to play and browse Peertube servers, channels and files.

**Changes**
- v0.1.2 Add error correction for raspberry pi based systems to make app usable.

**Installation**
An installable .zip can be downloaded from releases tab.
Do **not** try to install a .zip generated by GitHub. You need the plugin folder in the zip file (plugin.video.pt) for it to work. Otherwise Kodi will tell you the file structure is wrong and the install will fail.

**Note**: This plugin is very early in development so please be patient. I have just been able to make it work and will add more features later. Current functionalities: Browse Peertube Servers featured on https://instances.joinpeertube.org, browse videos of these servers, play videos. If somewhing doesnt work or the video does not play for more than a minute, check your internet connection or restart the plugin.

Source: This plugin was inspired by this tutorial plugin: https://github.com/romanvm/plugin.video.example, featured on https://kodi.wiki/view/HOW-TO:Video_addon 

**Warning**: This app is only compatible with python3 and modern kodi variants. for the older kodi variants, please use the official peertube plugin by framasoft.
