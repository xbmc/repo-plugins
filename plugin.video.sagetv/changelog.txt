[B]Version 1.3.8 (Nov 8, 2012)[/B]

[B]Version 1.3.7 (Nov 1, 2012)[/B]

[B]Version 1.3.6 (Nov 1, 2012)[/B]

- Added resume/partially watched support (e.g. if you've started to watch a show in SageTV, XBMC will know this and prompt you if you want to resume at the same point in SageTV); note that this does NOT sync the progress or watched status from XBMC back to SageTV

[B]Version 1.2.5 (Sep 25, 2012)[/B]

- Support up to 5 recording directory mappings
- Updated how airings/recordings of various genres are displayed (e.g. Movies vs. TV Shows)
- Updated thumbnail and poster images
- Significant performance improvement when displaying lists of shows and episodes (this was accomplished by completely re-doing) how the metadata is pulled and implemented a custom sagex .js file that enables the addon on to only pull the metadata it needs and nothing more)
- Enhanced "Search for Airings" and "Search for Recordings" to 1) be case insensitive, 2, search for a substring vs. the exact string, and 3) search across the show title, episode title, and description fields (vs. just the show title filed before)
- Added check to see if sagex-api-services is installed and then to check that the minimum required version is installed which this addon requires
