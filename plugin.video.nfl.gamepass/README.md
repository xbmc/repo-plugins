# NFL Game Pass Kodi Plugin #
**version 0.9.0 — Charles Woodson Edition**

Before reading any further, please understand that while this addon does work,
not all features are supported (or fully tested) and it should be forever
regarded as a beta release. It may crash, spay your puppy, and/or cause your
oven to not heat to 400° F properly.

If you're interested in helping out, just drop us an email or send a pull
request. Patches and (constructive) input are always welcome.

## Any Dependencies? ##

This addon requires Kodi Jarvis or later. XBMC Helix and Isengard will be
supported for awhile in the the "Isengard" branch.

This addon is part of the official Kodi repository, thus all dependencies are
installed automatically. However, if you're installing straight from source,
make sure the following two dependencies are installed:
 * xmltodict (http://mirrors.kodi.tv/addons/gotham/script.module.xmltodict/)
 * Requests 2.x (http://mirrors.kodi.tv/addons/jarvis/script.module.requests/)

## What is NFL Game Pass? ##

NFL Game Pass is website that allows those with subscriptions to watch NFL
games. Archives of old games stretch back to 2009, coaches film (22 man view) is
available, as is audio from each team's radio network. Overall, it is a sweet
service offered by the NFL for those of us who must have our American Football
fix.

## What is Game Pass Domestic? ##

NFL Game Pass Domestic is the USA version of Game Pass, but the service is
blacked out during live games. Previously it lacked other features, but with the
recent revamping (mid-2015) of their service, we have yet to find a side-by-side
comparison of the two services. Testing, bug reports, and patches from Game Pass
Domestic users would be most appreciated.

## Why write a plugin for Kodi? ##

First off, we love Kodi and like consuming media through its interface.
Secondly, while there is a nice Flash interface, it's... well... written in
Flash. The client is a resource hog, the interface is frequently buggy, and it
includes a bunch of bells and whistles (social media, for example) that are
simply distracting. We're here to watch a game, nothing else.

## What features are currently supported? ##

By now, most core features are supported.

 * Archived games from 2011 to 2014 (both full and condensed)
 * Live games

## Release names ##

Want a release to be named after your player/coach of choice? Contribute to the
project in some way (code, art, debugging, beer, brazen — yet effective —
flattery, etc), and we'll gladly name a future release after them.

## Roadmap ##

A rough roadmap follows:

* Continue work towards feature completeness
* Stabilize Game Pass Domestic support
* Code cleanup
