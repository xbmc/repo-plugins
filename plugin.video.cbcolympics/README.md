CBC Olympics
============

A Kodi/XBMC plugin for watching the CBC Olympics streams

Behaviour
============
By default only the highest bitrate streams are used (typically 720p30 ~3 Mbit/s) however the addon features a setting that can be set to limit this in case you're on a limited bandwidth connection. Available stream choices are 3 Mbit/s (default), 2 Mbit/s, 1.2 Mbit/s, 700 kbit/s, 400 kbit/s, and 256 kbit/s. Incredibly, it's still watchable at the lowest setting though the resolution is 416x234.

The best way to install this is from the official Kodi repository. If you need to install it manually, follow [the steps outlined in the Kodi documentation](https://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on_manager#How_to_install_from_a_ZIP_file).
