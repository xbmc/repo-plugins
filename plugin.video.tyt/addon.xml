  <description lang="en">Make Sure to set your username and password in addon settings.  All videos that are accessible from the website are playable.  If there is an error, the website hasn't migrated the video from GBox, and won't play on the website either.  Change the view setting in left tab to media info to get video summaries.  Make sure to configure YouTube plugin, and make sure it has API Key/Enable Personal API Keys enabled in settings.</description>
