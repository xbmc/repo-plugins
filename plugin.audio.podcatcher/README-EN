To run the plugin a user-related opml.xml is needed to be placed in <XBMC-Home>/userdata/addon_data/plugin.audio.PodCatcher/. Use your default rss-reader to generate this file, this saves time;) 
This Plugin supports following OPML - Outline attributes:
  * xmlUrl = the kink to the feed
  * type = feed-type
  * text = userdefined feed-title
  * fetchInterval = time in minutes between two refreshes. alternative: hourly,daily,weekly,monthly
  * maxArticleAge = number of days how old a article maximal can be
  * maxArticleNumber = maximal amount of articles

the last both attributes don't affect the amount of bytes loaded or parsed. They affect how much is displayed an localy cached. Keep this files small and all runs fast ;)
