v2.3.5 (2018-01-31)
- small fix (not using future's old_div anymore) that hopefully prevents crashing on android.

v2.3.4 (2018-01-20)

- addon now works in kode python 2 and should also work in python 3 (!!) once all dependencies work in python 3.
Kudo's to the python future package for making this possible. Kudo's to RomanVM for the help.
