# Kodi/XBMC plugin for LBRY

This is a basic plugin for accessing [LBRY](https://lbry.com) content (video's only, for now).

By default you don't need to install any extra software to start using this LBRY plugin, the plugin uses the API server provided by lbry.tv (https://api.lbry.tv/api/v1/proxy).

Alternatively, you can run your own API server and contribute to the LBRY network by hosting content data of videos you watched. This enables the 'Download' feature in the plugin, so you can watch videos uninterrupted or save the video to a local file. Also this enables wallet features like watching paid videos or tipping authors.

You will need to run `lbrynet` client (installation described here: https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-sdk) and have a bit of storage space available.
