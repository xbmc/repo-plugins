**SRF Play TV** (plugin.video.srfplaytv) is a Kodi plugin to access the video library of the Swiss Radio and Television (SRF).
This repository is kept as minimal as possible. All the relevant code resides in [script.module.srgssr](https://github.com/goggle/script.module.srgssr).

## Goals of the plugin
Get the [SRF Play TV media library](https://www.srf.ch/play/tv) on your TV (or another device) via [Kodi](https://kodi.tv/). The plugin aims to be close to the original media library, so that the experience of consuming media through the browser or through Kodi should be similar.

## Features
 - [x] Overview over all the shows
 - [x] Manage a list of your favourite SRF shows and get a list of your recently aired favourite shows
 - [ ] List and play segments for shows (if available), so you don't have to watch the whole episode if you are only interested in a specific section
 - [x] Search videos
 - [x] Choose between SD and HD quality
 - [x] Subtitle support
 - [ ] Livestreams that are exclusively broadcasted on SRF.ch (only available in Switzerland).
 - [ ] Live TV support: SRF 1, SRF 2 and SRF info (only available in Switzerland).
 - [x] SRF on YouTube: Browse the official SRF channels on YouTube.
