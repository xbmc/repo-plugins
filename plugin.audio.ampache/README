	Troubleshooting:
	
        Nextcloud music don't use api-key, but username/password, if you have problems to connect unckeck api_key box
        
        Web controls works better with the old search interface, it is possibile to enable in the settings
        
        The crashes in kodi are due to bugs in kodi 18.5-19 ( double busy dialog bug ) and in kore app.
        
        To avoid random crashes in kodi don't do any operation in the last five seconds of a song, 
        due to a kodi bug, playing next song generates a busy dialog ( impossible to avoid )
        and operating on kodi generates another busy dialog.
        
        The combination of two busy dialogs working crashes kodi (https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/issues/16756)
