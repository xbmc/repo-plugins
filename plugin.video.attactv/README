Initial release 0.0.5

This XBMC plugin allows to watch the videos from the ATTAC TV web site.


ATTAC is an international organization involved in the alter-globalization movement. They oppose neo-liberal globalization and develop social, ecological, and democratic alternatives so as to guarantee fundamental rights for all. Specifically, they fight for the regulation of financial markets, the closure of tax havens, the introduction of global taxes to finance global public goods, the cancellation of the debt of developing countries, fair trade, and the implementation of limits to free trade and capital flows.

The "Association pour la Taxation des Transactions financière et l'Aide aux Citoyens" (Association for the Taxation of financial Transactions and Aid to Citizens) was founded in France in December 1998 after the publication in the Monde Diplomatique of an editorial entitled "Désarmer les marchés" (Disarm the markets) that launched the notion of creating an association to promote the Tobin tax.

The organization expanded very rapidly into the rest of the world with an ATTAC network around an international charter set up in 1999. Today, the association is active in some 40 countries, with over a thousand local groups and hundreds of organizations supporting the network. (source: http://www.attac.org/en/overview)


The ATTAC TV web site has its videos hosted at several locations, as Youtube, Vimeo, and BlipTV, so this plugin requires of those great three plugins from "The Collective" to be installed to work (don't worry if you don't have them installed at the time of installation: XBMC will do it automatically for you). 

Through the Add-on settings you can configure the language prefered to watch the videos.
The ATTAC TV web site supports four languages (and so the plugin does): Spanish, English, French, and German.
If your default GUI language is one of those, then you don't have to do anything into the settings to watch the videos, except maybe to activate the subtitles with your prefered language into the Youtube video plugin. 

This is the first release of the plugin, so there are some sources for videos not yet supported, as those from the spanish RTVE channel.

To install it simply download the zip file, and then proceed as with any other plugin from XBMC:
 System->Settings->Add-ons->Install from zip file.

Any issues detected can be reported using this forum thread for official support: http://forum.xbmc.org/showthread.php?tid=155306

Enjoy it!
